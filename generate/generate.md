Generate TZ Data
---------------

####Instructions:

- run `go run main.go` from within the generate directory...that's it.

Generate will not work on all systems, but that's ok, it's just used to created the tz_data.go file at the root of the project. If anybody wants to help make it Cross OS compatible I'm open to pull requests.
